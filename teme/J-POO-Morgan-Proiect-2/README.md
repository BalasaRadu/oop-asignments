        * Main - the Main class runs the checker on your implementation. Add the entry point to your implementation in it. Run Main to test your implementation from the IDE or from command line.
        * Test - run the main method from Test class with the name of the input file from the command line and the result will be written
          to the out.txt file. Thus, you can compare this result with ref.
* input/ - contains the tests in JSON format
* ref/ - contains all reference output for the tests in JSON format
